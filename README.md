# Operating-System-Interprocess-Communication

This repository contains solutions to the fifth series of exercises for the Operating Systems course. The exercises focus on implementing **process management**, **shared memory**, **pipes**, and **concurrency control**. Below is a list of the problems solved in this repository:

## Problems Solved

1. **Sum of Prime Numbers Using Pipes**
   - Uses multiple child processes to find prime numbers less than 100 million and calculates their sum using **pipes** for inter-process communication.
   - [View Code](Prime_Sum_Pipes/)

2. **Max Pooling with Shared Memory**
   - Implements the **max pooling** operation on a matrix using **POSIX shared memory** and multiple processes for parallel computation.
   - [View Code](Max_Pooling_Shared_Memory/)

3. **Distributed Merge Sort**
   - Implements a distributed **merge sort** algorithm using **shared memory** and multiple processes to sort an array in parallel.
   - [View Code](Distributed_Merge_Sort/)
